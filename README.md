## Generic Overview
- Various projects to work on linux scripting for sys admin work.

## Main Projects:
- In each of the section project folder I worked on using bash scripts to automate a given task. In the 5th folder was my biggest task in which I processed a large file and determined which IP address were maliciosly trying to login into a given server and then display this data in csv format.

## Multinet Project:
- In the multinet directory, I used vagrant to instantiate a set of servers in an interconnected network to mimin common netowrking and sysadmin issues.
